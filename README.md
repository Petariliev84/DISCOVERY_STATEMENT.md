DISCOVERY STATEMENT

SRP-Stabilized Earth–Mars Resonant Cycler Orbit

Official Discovery Claim
I, Petar Iliev Dryanovski, have discovered and characterized a novel class of interplanetary trajectory, termed SRP-stabilized Earth–Mars resonant cycler orbit, in which Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) is actively used to stabilize and fine-tune the orbit, maintaining near-resonant, repeatable encounters between Earth and Mars. This discovery is supported by 30+ years of propagated orbital data (2035–2065) demonstrating bounded distance minima, convergence, and self-optimizing approach geometries.
