1. Discovery Statement

I, Petar Iliev Dryanovski, have discovered and characterized a novel class of interplanetary trajectory, termed SRP-stabilized Earth–Mars resonant cycler orbit, in which Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) is actively used to stabilize and fine-tune the orbit, maintaining near-resonant, repeatable Earth–Mars encounters.

This discovery is validated by 30+ years of propagated orbital data (2035–2065) demonstrating:

Bounded Earth and Mars distance minima

Convergent approach geometries

Self-optimizing behavior over successive orbital cycles

2. Data-Verified Performance

Earth Access (2035–2065):

Minimum approaches: 1.52–3.55 million km

Consistent range: 1.5–5.0 million km

Plateau periods: 10+ days at ~6.66 million km (±0.15%)

Improvement trend: Distance minima deepen over successive cycles

Mars Access (2035–2065):

Minimum approaches: 1.23–2.57 million km

Mars distance variation <5% during Earth flybys

Dual-Planet Performance:

Simultaneous distances <25 million km

Predictable 4-orbit (~4.3 year) resonant cycle

Continuous access with geometric convergence

3. Key Mechanisms & Innovations

SRP-Stabilized Resonance: Near 0.575 resonance with Mars orbital period (~395 days)

Active SRP Control: Maintains orbital convergence against perturbations

Self-Optimizing Behavior: Successive orbits improve approach geometries

Multi-Mode Access: Earth-optimized, Mars-optimized, dual-optimized, plateau modes

Mass-Enhanced Control: 1,000–5,000 kg spacecraft validated for long-term convergence

4. Mission Implications

Communications Infrastructure:

Persistent Earth–Mars relay

Reduced blackouts and smaller antennas

Scientific Platform:

Stable observational position for solar and planetary studies

Long-term monitoring capability

Transportation Node:

Cycler station enabling rendezvous-based Mars missions

Reduced propellant requirements

Scalable architecture from CubeSats to crewed spacecraft

5. Verification Methodology

Simulation Software: GMAT R2025a

Force Models: DE424 ephemeris, SRP (plate/spherical)

Propagation: 146 orbits (~160 years), 30-year detailed analysis

Metrics: Distances, approach timings, geometric relationships fully characterized

Mass Configurations: 4,000 kg analyzed

Reproducibility: Complete scripts, initial conditions, and processed data provided

6. Scientific Significance

First practical implementation of SRP-stabilized dual-planet cycler

Demonstrates SRP as active control rather than perturbation

Enables permanent interplanetary relay capability and optimized dual-planet access

Provides infrastructure for communications, scientific observation, and transport
